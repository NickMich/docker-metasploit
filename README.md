# Kali Linux Metasploit

The team over at [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org) just released a base Kali Docker image- awesome! However, their [official page](https://www.kali.org/news/official-kali-linux-docker-images/) for this bit of news suggests to jump into a bash shell of a container and:

```
apt-get install metasploit
```

which works... but isn't very Docker-esque.

This builds your base image along with [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/) ready for use.
